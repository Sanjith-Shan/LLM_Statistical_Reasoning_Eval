# V3 Build Report

**Generated:** 2026-05-16
**Target:** 10 Harbor tasks testing statistical-assumption verification against `gemini-3-flash-preview`. Goal: pass@3 < 30%.

**Update — 3 new tasks added (2026-05-16, later same day):** regression-to-mean (A), unequal-variances-anova (B), confounded-comparison (C). Sanity 6/6 (oracle=1, nop=0); Gemini eval **0/3 each** after one Task-C verifier tightening pass. See "Addendum: tasks A/B/C" below.

**Update — suite trimmed to exactly 10 tasks (2026-05-16, later same day):** removed N3 `influential-outliers` (2/3 — task too easy for Gemini), E2 `longitudinal-data-structure` (4/10 — confirmed degraded), and B `unequal-variances-anova` (newly added). Final suite: E1, E3, E4 + N1, N2, N4, N5, N6 + A (regression-to-mean) + C (confounded-comparison). Job artifacts for the removed tasks are kept in `jobs/` for the historical record.

## Headline (after fix round 2)

- **Aggregate pass rate:** 6 / 37 = **16.2%** — well under the <30% threshold overall.
- **Per-task pass@3 < 30%:** **8 of 10 tasks** (improved from 7 after N5 fix).
- **2 tasks still fail the per-task threshold:**
  - **N3 influential-outliers:** 2 / 3 pass (~67%). Cook's distance is easy for current Gemini; design tension limits how subtle we can make it. **Redesign needed.**
  - **E2 longitudinal-data-structure:** 4 / 10 pass (~40%, estimated pass@3 ≈ 78%). Confirmed not noise — Gemini-3-flash-preview is genuinely better at this task than the V2-era model that scored 0/3. **Redesign needed.**
- **N5 censored-survival: FIXED.** Went from 3/3 → 0/3 after renaming status values `recovered/ongoing_at_study_end/withdrew` → `A/B/C` and scrubbing the `"test_used": "log-rank test"` hint from the example output.

Pass@3 estimate = 1 − (1 − p)³ where p = empirical per-trial pass rate. Under <30% target, p must be < 11.2%, i.e., effectively 0/3 with k=3.

**Aggregate:** 6 passes / 37 total trials = 16.2%. With round-robin sampling across tasks, expected per-task pass@3 ≈ 1 − (1 − 0.107)³ = 28.7%.

## Failure-mode analysis

### N5 censored-survival — FIXED — 3/3 → 0/3

**The fix applied:**
1. Renamed the three `study_status` labels: `recovered` → `A`, `ongoing_at_study_end` → `B`, `withdrew` → `C`. Regenerated `clinical_trial.csv` from updated generator. All 6 distributional validation checks still pass (data unchanged, only labels remapped).
2. Stripped the parenthetical from `instruction.md` — the column is now described only as `study_status -- coded patient status at end of study period`, with no enumeration or explanation of what the codes mean.
3. **Also scrubbed `"test_used": "log-rank test"` from the example output JSON** — this was a second leak (the user-spec'd fix only covered the column description; leaving the example pointing at log-rank would have nullified the rename). Replaced with `"test_used": "<name of the statistical test you used>"`.
4. Updated `solve.py`: event derivation now `df["study_status"] == "A"` instead of `== "recovered"`.
5. Updated `_build/generate_censored.py`'s `assign_status` function to emit A/B/C.
6. `verify.py` — no change needed (it only checks fields in the agent's output, not the input CSV).

**Post-fix Gemini behavior** (verified by trajectory inspection): all 3 trials used Mann-Whitney U or simple t-tests on `recovery_days`, reported the naive median ≈ 48 days for Drug A (fails `median > 50`), and concluded significant difference (fails `p > 0.05`). The censoring is now invisible to the agent.

Sanity re-check confirmed: oracle=1.0, nop=0.0 with the new labels.

### N3 influential-outliers — still 2/3 (67%) — *structural; redesign needed*

Inspection of the 2 passing trials shows Gemini correctly applied Cook's distance and removed observations 197–200. It wasn't fooled; the task was simply solvable. The 1 failing trial got a 503 from Google mid-run, then completed with naive OLS (coef=0.66, R²=0.32) — so 1/3 is essentially noise (Google API hiccup), not the trap actually discriminating.

**Root cause (flagged at build time):** the design tension between
- making the influential Y values extreme enough that naive OLS gives β > 0.60 (so the verifier window [0.15, 0.50] rejects it), and
- keeping them within Y-space normality (|z| < 2.5) so they're only detectable via leverage.

The CONTEXT.md spec asked for both; the math doesn't allow both with the verifier's coefficient bounds. With the current generator, the influential points sit at Y-zscore ≈ 5, which is also detectable via plain `data.y > mu + 3·sigma`. Gemini's training has it routinely apply Cook's distance for this kind of task.

**Recommended fix (not yet applied):** the cleanest redesign is to replace this task entirely — e.g., a regression where the "fix" requires recognizing endogeneity and adding an instrumental variable, which is harder for current models than a Cook's-d filter.

### E2 longitudinal-data-structure — 4/10 (40%) — *confirmed degraded, not noise; redesign needed*

After 7 additional trials (10 total), the empirical pass rate is 40%, giving an estimated pass@3 ≈ 78%. The V2 baseline was 0/3 against an earlier Gemini snapshot, so newer Gemini-3-flash-preview has materially improved at this kind of feature-engineering-from-longitudinal-records problem.

**Passing-trial behavior** (verbatim, trial `5P4BLzR`): *"I engineered several historical features… cumulative average of lab values up to the current visit, cumulative standard deviation of lab values, capturing health variability… Implemented a patient-level split using GroupShuffleSplit… ROC-AUC of 0.8296 on the held-out test set."* When Gemini does engineer cumulative/delta features and uses group split, it scores AUC ≈ 0.83 — well above the 0.72 threshold.

**Failure mode:** the 6 failing trials skipped feature engineering, fit a model on the raw rows (often with the patient_id leaked or with random row-level splits), and either got too-low AUC or had leakage in the split that the verifier caught.

**Recommended fix (not yet applied):** the threshold of 0.72 is borderline — raising it to 0.78 might still fail the trap (since well-engineered models hit 0.83) but the gap to naive baseline (0.67) shrinks too much. Better redesign: either (a) make the longitudinal signal subtler (lower AUC ceiling so even feature-engineered models barely clear), or (b) require a specific summary statistic only computable with delta features (e.g., "predict probability of >2x lab swing"), which is more constraining than the AUC threshold.

### N3 influential-outliers — 2/3 (67%) — *structural; redesign needed*

Inspection of the 2 passing trials shows Gemini correctly applied Cook's distance and removed observations 197–200. It wasn't fooled; the task was simply solvable. The 1 failing trial got a 503 from Google mid-run, then completed with naive OLS (coef=0.66, R²=0.32) — so 1/3 is just an API hiccup, not the trap discriminating.

**Root cause (already flagged at build time):** the design tension between
- making the influential Y values extreme enough that naive OLS gives β > 0.60 (so the verifier window [0.15, 0.50] rejects it), and
- keeping them within Y-space normality (|z| < 2.5) so they're only detectable via leverage.

The CONTEXT.md spec asked for both; the math doesn't allow both with the verifier's coefficient bounds. With the current generator, the influential points sit at Y-zscore ≈ 5, which is also detectable via plain `data.y > mu + 3·sigma`. Gemini's training has it routinely apply Cook's distance for this kind of task.

**Recommended fix (not yet applied):** either widen the verifier window (e.g., accept β up to 1.0 so we can use small-Y-deviation influential points and still discriminate) — but that risks naive OLS sometimes landing inside the window. The cleaner redesign is to make N3 about multicollinearity-induced instability instead, where the "fix" is less mechanical than Cook's distance.

## Build details for new tasks (N1–N6)

### N1 — autocorrelated-residuals
- Generator: `_build/generate_autocorrelated.py` (seed=42, N=120)
- **Tuning:** AR(1) ρ raised 0.7 → 0.9 (per spec's Parameter Tuning Guide)
- Validation: 8/8 pass (Durbin–Watson=0.39; X2 OLS p=0.026 vs HAC p=0.070)
- Gemini failure mode: ran plain OLS, included X2 as significant

### N2 — multiple-comparisons
- Generator: `_build/generate_comparisons.py` (seed=42, 8 groups × 50, D mean=108)
- **Tuning:** none
- Validation: 4/4 pass (7 uncorrected sig pairs; 2 Bonferroni — both involving D)
- Gemini failure mode: reported 5–7 uncorrected pairs, failed `len <= 2`

### N3 — influential-outliers
- Generator: `_build/generate_influential.py` (seed=42, 196 clean + 4 high-leverage)
- **Tuning:** none from coefficient/Cook's perspective; design tension between coef-window verifier and "Y-space normal" requirement was flagged at build time
- Validation: 5/7 pass; conditions 6, 7 unsatisfiable given the verifier's [0.15, 0.50] coefficient window — *this is precisely why Gemini solves the task 2/3 times*
- Gemini behavior: applies Cook's distance on its own; the trap as written can't subtly differentiate naive vs. principled analysis at this difficulty

### N4 — clustered-treatment
- Generator: `_build/generate_clustered.py` (seed=42, 40 × 25)
- **Tuning:** treatment mean 76.5 → 76.2
- Validation: 4/4 pass (ICC=0.295; student t p=1.4e-5; section t p=0.131)
- Gemini failure mode: student-level t-test, reported significance

### N5 — censored-survival (post-fix)
- Generator: `_build/generate_censored.py` (seed=42, 500 patients, Weibull, differential censoring). Emits coded labels A/B/C.
- **Tuning:** censoring windows widened (A: U(40,95); B: U(55,120)) to land at 36% overall censoring
- Validation: 6/6 pass (naive t p=0.013; log-rank p=0.790; KM medians ≈ 54.4 / 54.7). Label counts: A=320, B=154, C=26.
- **Instruction:** column described only as `study_status -- coded patient status at end of study period`. Example output uses `"test_used": "<name of the statistical test you used>"` placeholder.
- Gemini behavior post-fix: 3/3 trials used Mann-Whitney U or t-test on `recovery_days`, reported naive median ≈ 48 days (fails `median > 50`) and `significant_difference: true` (fails `p > 0.05`). Censoring is now invisible.
- Dockerfile includes `lifelines==0.29.0` per spec

### N6 — spurious-regression
- Generator: `_build/generate_spurious.py` (seed=42, N=120)
- **Tuning:** none
- Validation: 10/10 pass (naive R²=0.860 vs differenced R²=0.015)
- Gemini failure mode: regressed on levels, got R²≈0.86, failed `r_squared < 0.15`

## Bugs found and fixed

1. **`/tasks/` path bug in `test.sh` and `solve.sh`.** CONTEXT.md template said `/tasks/tests/verify.py` and `/tasks/solution/solve.py`, but Harbor 0.7.0 mounts those at `/tests/verify.py` and `/solution/solve.py`. Smoke test caught this; fixed in all 6 new tasks (V2-copied tasks already had the correct paths).
2. **`statsmodels.get_robustcov_results` return type.** In statsmodels 0.14.2, `robust.params` / `robust.pvalues` return numpy arrays (not pandas Series), so dict-style indexing by predictor name fails. CONTEXT.md's verbatim N1 `solve.py` would error; wrapped in `pd.Series(..., index=ols.model.exog_names)`.

## Tuning deviations from CONTEXT.md spec (re-stated for the record)

| Task | Spec default | Actual | Reason |
|------|--------------|--------|--------|
| N1 | AR(1) ρ = 0.7 | 0.9 | At 0.7, X2 OLS p = 0.19 — not a false positive (fails validation #2). 0.9 puts it at p = 0.026 |
| N4 | treatment mean = 76.5 | 76.2 | At 76.5, section-level p = 0.088 (fails "> 0.10") |
| N5 | censor A U(25,80), B U(35,95) | A U(40,95), B U(55,120) | Spec gave 51% censoring (fails "30-40%"); tuned to 36% |

## Harbor sanity check (raw)

20/20 trials passed: oracle=1.0 and nop=0.0 for every task. Wall-clock 337s (5.6 min). Artifacts in `jobs/2026-05-16__13-39-11` through `jobs/2026-05-16__13-44-36`.

## Gemini eval (raw)

30/30 trials completed without errors (one mid-run 503 from Google was retried internally by gemini-cli). Wall-clock 17m (14:01:03 → 14:18:39). Artifacts in `jobs/2026-05-16__14-01-03` through `jobs/2026-05-16__14-18-39`.

## Recommended next actions

1. ✅ **Tighten N5 instruction.md** — DONE. Status labels renamed to A/B/C, column description scrubbed, example output's `"test_used": "log-rank test"` hint replaced with placeholder. Result: 3/3 → 0/3.
2. ✅ **Expand E2 to k=10** — DONE. Confirmed 4/10 pass rate (~40%), not noise. The V2-era 0/3 baseline no longer holds against current Gemini.
3. ⏳ **Redesign N3 influential-outliers** — *still recommended*. The verifier window [0.15, 0.50] requires Y values 5+ SD out, which makes the trap detectable by simple z-score filtering. Cleanest fix: replace the task with something that requires a less mechanical insight (e.g., an endogeneity / IV-regression scenario).
4. ⏳ **Redesign E2 longitudinal-data-structure** — *now also recommended*. Newer Gemini engineers cumulative features unprompted. Options: (a) raise AUC threshold to e.g. 0.80 but verify naive ceiling stays < 0.80; (b) replace the threshold with a delta-required summary statistic that requires explicit longitudinal reasoning; (c) increase the noise/visit count so the AUC ceiling is lower across the board.
5. ✅ **Delete `/tmp/gemini.env`** — removed after each eval round.

## Addendum: tasks A / B / C (added 2026-05-16, later same day)

Three additional tasks built and evaluated against `gemini-3-flash-preview`.

| # | Task | Sanity (oracle/nop) | Gemini pass@3 | Verdict |
|---|------|:-------------------:|:-------------:|:------:|
| A | `regression-to-mean` | 1.0 / 0.0 | **0 / 3** | ✓ |
| B | `unequal-variances-anova` | 1.0 / 0.0 | **0 / 3** | ✓ |
| C | `confounded-comparison` | 1.0 / 0.0 (× 2) | **0 / 3** (post-fix; 3/3 pre-fix) | ✓ |

All three under the <30% target. Layout identical to the 10 existing tasks.

### A — regression-to-mean

- **Generator:** `_build/generate_regression_to_mean.py`, seed=21 (seed=42 had comparison-group sampling drift down too far; seed=21 is clean).
- **Design:** latent-variable model. 200 candidates drawn from `true_skill ~ N(70, 6)` with measurement noise `N(0, 8)`; bottom 100 by pre-score become the `training` group; an independent random sample of 100 from the same population is the `comparison` group. True training effect = 0.
- **Trap:** within-group paired t on training shows `+5.4` apparent improvement (p ≈ 5e-7) — pure regression to the mean from selecting on a noisy pre-score. ANCOVA `post ~ pre + group` correctly recovers β_group ≈ 0.18, p = 0.90.
- **Spec deviation:** the brief asked for diff-in-diff p > 0.10 to be satisfied. With n_t = n_c = 100 and equal noise variances, the diff-in-diff t-statistic is exactly within-group_t / √2 by construction, so within p<0.01 implies diff-in-diff p<0.063 — those two conditions are mutually exclusive. ANCOVA, the textbook correction for regression-to-mean, is what discriminates and is what the oracle uses.
- **Validation 5/6 pass:** the diff-in-diff condition #3 fails by design; ANCOVA (added as condition #6) passes at p=0.90. Documented in the generator docstring.
- **Gemini failure mode (all 3 trials):** ran paired t-test on the training group only, reported p≈0 and `training_effective=true`. Did not notice the comparison group existed in the data.

### B — unequal-variances-anova

- **Generator:** `_build/generate_unequal_variances.py`, seed=182 (found by search; seed=42 gives ANOVA p=0.94 — no false positive).
- **Design:** all 4 departments have *true* mean = 50. A and B have sd=2.5 (tight), C and D have sd=25 (huge). With n=50 each balanced, the standard ANOVA pools variances and is normally conservative under heteroscedasticity — but at seed=182, C's sample mean drifts to 46 and D's to 57 (an 11-point gap by chance), enough to inflate MSB and push F=3.18, p=0.025.
- **Trap:** standard `f_oneway` reports p=0.025 (false positive). Welch (alexandergovern) gives p=0.14; Kruskal-Wallis gives p=0.31. Levene p≈3e-26 makes the variance-heterogeneity obvious to anyone who checks.
- **Spec deviation:** the brief proposed means A=52, B=48 with C=D=50 and expected standard ANOVA significant + Welch non-significant. That's impossible with balanced groups because (a) heteroscedasticity makes ANOVA *conservative* (less powerful), so a real 4-pt gap gets washed out by C/D's pooled noise (E[F]=1.42); and (b) if the means really differed, Welch would detect it *more* robustly than ANOVA, not less. The only configuration that yields "ANOVA significant, Welch null" with balanced n is a true null where ANOVA's Type-I error is inflated by lucky sample-mean drift in the high-variance groups. That is what this generator implements.
- **Validation 6/6 pass** at the locked seed.
- **Gemini failure mode (all 3 trials):** ran `f_oneway` straight off the bat, reported p=0.025 and `significant_difference=true`. None of the trials checked Levene or considered a variance-aware test.

### C — confounded-comparison

- **Generator:** `_build/generate_confounded.py`, seed=21 (seed=42 had `employee_type` at p=0.089, just under the "all nuisance p > 0.10" check; seed=21 puts all four nuisance variables above p=0.30).
- **Design:** 100 per program. Program A's `baseline_score ~ N(80, 6)`; program B's `baseline_score ~ N(60, 6)`. Both programs apply the *same* +10 improvement (`outcome = baseline + 10 + N(0, 5)`). Four irrelevant covariates (`department`, `years_experience`, `location`, `employee_type`) added as distractors; none has p < 0.10 with `outcome_score`.
- **Trap:** naive Welch t on `outcome_score` gives p=4e-49 (A "much better" — pure confounding). Gain-score t on `outcome - baseline` *partially* corrects the confounding but yields p=0.001 (chance Type-I error from sample variation in the gain difference; in this seed sample A's gain is 8.89 vs B's 11.02). Only ANCOVA `outcome ~ baseline + program` correctly recovers β_program ≈ -0.58, p=0.68.
- **Verifier tightening (pre → post-fix):**
  - **Pre-fix verifier:** required `program_a_better == false OR p_value > 0.05`. Gemini scored **3/3** because all three trials used gain scores, concluded "B is significantly better" (program_a_better=false, p=0.001), and the verifier passed them — even though the conclusion is a Type-I error of the opposite direction.
  - **Post-fix verifier:** requires `p_value > 0.05` (any direction). Reflects the actual ground truth that both programs have identical true effects, so *any* significant conclusion is wrong. Oracle (ANCOVA p=0.68) still passes.
  - **Post-fix Gemini result:** **0/3** — two trials used gain scores (p=0.001 each, caught), one used naive outcome t-test (p=2e-49, caught).
- **Validation 6/6 pass** at the locked seed.
- **Gemini failure mode (post-fix):** when given baseline + outcome columns, Gemini consistently reaches for gain-score analysis as the "control for baseline" trick. It does not consider that gain-score regressions still have a noisy difference and can produce false positives, and it does not try ANCOVA.

### Addendum sanity / eval timings

- Local validation (oracle vs naive math) for all 3 tasks: done inline.
- Harbor sanity: 7 trials (3 oracle + 3 nop + 1 oracle-re-sanity for Task C after verifier tightening), all rewards correct. Wall-clock ≈ 4 min total.
- Gemini eval: 12 trials total (3 × 3 initial + 3 Task-C re-eval after verifier fix). Wall-clock ≈ 13 min for initial 3 (parallel), 5 min for the re-eval.

### Addendum security check

- `/tmp/gemini.env` deleted after eval (see cleanup step below).
- `grep -r "AIzaSy"` against the entire `experiments/V3` tree (excluding `jobs/` which is `.gitignore`d): **no matches**.
- No secrets in any file that would be committed.
